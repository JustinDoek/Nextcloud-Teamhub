# TeamHub v3.5 — Changes


## Admin Maintenance tab — full teams grid

Replaced the old "Orphaned teams" section with a full teams management grid covering every user-created team on the NC instance.
**What it does:** Paginated table with search by name, "orphans only" toggle, and per-page selector (10/20/50/100). Each row shows team name, description, member count, owner (display name + uid), and creation date. Two icon-only action buttons per row: set owner and delete.

---

## Set owner

Admin can assign any NC user as owner of any team — whether or not that user is currently a member.

## Delete team (admin)

Admin can delete any team regardless of ownership. Cleans up all associated data before destroying the circle.


TeamHub v3.6 — Changes
## Activity widget

Deck activity now scoped to the team's board only — card events (deck_card) and board events (deck_board) handled separately
Talk activity scoped to the team's room via numeric room ID — eliminates cross-team bleed
Calendar/DAV activity subject strings corrected to match real oc_activity values
Friendly human-readable labels for all Deck, Calendar, and Circles activity subjects

## Manage Team — Maintenance tab

"Danger Zone" tab renamed to "Maintenance"
Transfer ownership added — team owner can promote any current team member to owner
Ownership transfer requires two-step confirmation and demotes the current owner to admin
Leave team now shows the real server error message (e.g. "Transfer ownership before leaving")

## Admin Settings — Membership cache integrity

New section in the Maintenance tab: scan all teams for stale membership cache
Compares circles_member (source of truth) against circles_membership (share picker cache)
Per-team Repair button rebuilds the cache — fixes teams invisible to Files, Calendar and Deck share pickers

## Files 

Re-enabling the Files app for a team now works correctly
Favourite Files and Recently Modified widgets no longer appear on teams without a connected Files resource
